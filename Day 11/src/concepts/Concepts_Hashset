Hashset is a data structure which is widely used in the programming, It is very popular when comes to time complexity
since it provides amortized time complexity- O(1) for various operations like insertion, searching, deletion...
Unlike arrays or other data structure which sometime gives amortized time complexity for some operation but not for all
so it is known for its time complexity or when comes to optimizing the code.

Internally it is also an array but it is not necessary that elements stored in a continuous manner, so it is an unordered
way of storing element it may possible that sometime elements stored in a continuity but not all time

Like we studied sets in maths, here applies the same. Hashsets avoids duplicate.
It means if given many numbers and have to do operation on the unique elements then it is quite useful data structure.
