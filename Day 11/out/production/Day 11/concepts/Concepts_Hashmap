In Hashmap, two things to keep in mind - key , value.
Hashmap data structure contains two things in pair- key and value where key is always unique value, value may be same for
many or may not be same for others.
so when need to do operations maintaining unique values and have to get some result accordingly, use Hashmap data structure
for that particular problems, time complexity may be amortized for most of the cases so it is also a useful data structure
when comes to optimizing the solution .

for eg. store roll, name of students in a class and have to do operations then Hashmap can be used.
since roll will always be unique so it comes in the key and as we know name can be same for many students so it comes in
values. then can perform operations accordingly.
