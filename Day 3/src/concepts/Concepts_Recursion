Function calling itself is known to recursion.
Before recursion we create different methods and make a call to each other for doing tasks and when the execution finished
then it will come out to where it was called to. But in recursion no need to make multiple function for the task, one
function is able to do it alone by calling itself, important thing is to take care of the base condition. Since function
calls itself if not get stopped then when stack gets full then we get stack overflow error that will not the best for the
optimization and the memory management.

Why recursion
1. It makes easy to solve the bigger or complex problems.
2. Every recursive solution can be converted to iterative solution
3. Code looks cleaner and smooth using recursion
4. Bigger problems breaks down into smaller problem using recursion
5. Space complexity is not constant since due to function calls that takes separate memory allocation till it gets executed.

Can make a flow of function call and the returning of the function that is called recursive tree.

Three things to take care of
1. Arguments : put things that are going to be used in the next function call in the arguments
2. Body : Use different variable accordingly and use it for managing things in the arguments
3. Return : return everytime when dealing with the function calls.
