Main use case of String Builder is that no new object is created everytime. Objects can be modified and is possible
using it, Although all the properties can be understood as same.
It is like special beneficial power is given to String by using String Builder.

        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            char ch = (char) ('a' + i);
            // no new object is created, modified in the existing one
            builder.append(ch);
        }
        System.out.print(builder);
