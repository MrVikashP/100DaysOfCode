Stack data structure follows Last in Last out - LILO properties or First in First out - FIFO properties.

for eg. - We can understand using daily life examples like when we go to watch movies, first thing we encounter is ticket
counter where people are standing making a line where no corruption allowed since people will start fighting. so the first
person who is in line will get the ticket first and then rest people will take ticket in the same way.

Push means entering the elements.
Pop means deleting the elements.

Insertion and deletion takes constant time, since it is implemented as array internally.
