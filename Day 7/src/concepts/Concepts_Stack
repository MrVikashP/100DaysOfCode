Stack data structure follows Last in First out - LIFO properties or First in Last out - FILO properties.

Since in recursion we understand about stack memory where function gets removed when its work is done and last function
gets removed first and then respectively other function will do the same. That is why the main function is removed at last.
and we get the output at the screen.

for eg. - We can understand using daily life examples like when we go to any marriage Eating is the most valuable thing
we never miss so when entering the arena, food plates are placed in an order and different person go and take their plates
and then starts enjoying the meal. When noticed the last plate that is above all will be taken first and then same for all.

Push means entering the elements.
Pop means deleting the elements.

Insertion and deletion takes constant time, since it is implemented as array internally.
